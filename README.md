The study was carried out using Python v. 3.7.3 and Jupyter Notebook. The .ipynb file is available for download along with the dataset folder, containing 1 .csv file. [Click here to see the notebook as an HTML page](https://alepoptosis.github.io/stardew_valley_survey/sv_survey.html).

## Introduction

Stardew Valley is a videogame developed by ConcernedApe. It is a widely popular farming simulator which allows the player, among other things, to court and marry one of 12 possible spouses: 6 men, the bachelors, and 6 women, the bachelorettes. Most characters follow fairly common formulas (i.e. the jock, the popular girl, the videogame nerd, the scientist, the poet etc.), therefore I believed it would be interesting to see whether players of different gender, sexual orientation, and age differ in the ranking of these characters. The data was collected by myself through a Google Form survey in July 2018.
